As a student at Wyncode, we were assigned projects on a weekly, and sometimes daily basis.  While learning a little more about the MVC model in Rails, we were assigned a project to create a small application, that took in a url, shortened it, and then redirected the original url to our shortened version.  Part of the project was to utilize heroku, and have heroku host and redirect all of the url's submitted.  I have included the heroku page below.

I utilized materialize, a front end framework, for simple styling, to give this simple app a cleaner look.
I took a screenshot of the actual heroku site, with the original links, as well as the redirected link. It is in the public folder of this repo.
