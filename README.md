As a student at Wyncode, we were assigned projects on a weekly, and sometimes daily basis.  While learning a little more about the MVC model in Rails, we were assigned a project to create a small application, that took in a url, shortened it, and then redirected the original url to our shortened version.  Part of the project was to utilize heroku, and have heroku host and redirect all of the url's submitted.  I have included the heroku page below.  I have to include a disclaimer here, though.  MOST LIKELY, the heroku link won't work for long, because without a paid account, heroku only gives me five different sites.  I am still learning, and hosting applications on heroku pretty consistently, so it MIGHT not be availabale for long!

BUT. i also took a screenshot of the actual heroku site, with the original links, as well as the redirected link. It is in the public folder of this repo.  
I was also in the process of learning how to use materialize, a front end framework, and i utilized it for giving this simple app a cleaner look.
